      "The Buff just feels like home.  It is the place to rehash last night's craziness and eat some really good food.  Oh yeah, and start the day off right with a bloody mary or a mimosa.  The Chimis are so incredibly awesome, and I live in Tucson, so that is a very high compliment.  The benedicts are good, and the sandwiches, don't forget waffle fries, drool...  The Buff is just the right combination of down home food and laid back attitude.If I could give it 0 Stars I would. I waited 40 minutes for a f$&king sandwich and when I asked for my money back he started asking me what my order was - he hadn't even started making it. The guy has no clue. Honestly these food carts are awful service in general but this guy shouldn't get a penny of your money.Really more of a 3.5, but I wanted to like it so much that it was that much more of a let down. \n",

      "The sandwich I had was pretty good (roasted veggies and goat cheese) but not worth the expense. I feel like that's going to be more or less the norm here - good, but way overpriced. A latte should not start at 4$. 9$ for lunch is just too much. \n",

Trusting a good hair stylist is hard. I did like the last one. However, the same friend who originally recommended me to go to her said she is no longer capable of doing a good job if you're going lighter and messed up her hair. Therefore, I had to look for someone else. After months of looking, a friend got her hair done and I fell in love with her hair. She told me who her stylist is and the price range. It was Kim at Q Hair Studio. In addition, she gave me a few other stylist that she has used before and the one her sister uses.\n",

      "My hair took a bit of work, close to 4 hours! Kim wanted to make sure the job was done right. She kept coming back and checking up on me and ensuring that she doesn't want me to come back unsatisfied.\n",

She spent a lot of time making sure my prescription was appropriate and that my contacts fit properly.  Most of the optometrists that I've seen have treated me much more like a number and didn't spend the time to fine tune my prescription and get the fit of my lenses right.  She also took the time to explain some things about the physical characteristics of my eyes and how to properly care for them.  It was also very easy to make an appointment online.\n"
